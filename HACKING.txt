Ready to get your hands dirty? Now it's quite easy :)

Make sure you have Android SDK, ant, and git installed.

The tools directory from your Android SDK should be in your path.
You can check that with:
$ echo $PATH
If it's not there, run:
$ PATH=$PATH:/home/user/sdk/android-sdk/tools
with the appropriate location of your Android SDK.

Kewl. New the fun part!

$ ant setup
will download all necessary dependencies (couple of jars and GreenDroid).

$ ant debug
will compile the project and create an apk signed with your debug key

$ ant install
will install that apk onto your running emulator / plugged in device.

Enjoy and happy hacking!

--- Developers note ---

If you add new downloadable jar files to the project, please add a wildcard to
.bzrignore to match it in libs/ , and "bzr remove" the existing file if
it's in the branch.

If you have fixed a bug or implemented a new feature, commit your code and
$ bzr push lp:~your_username/ubuntuone-android-files/your_branch_name
Go to launchpad, click 'Propose merge' and describe what you've changed.
Once you're done and confirm, we'll review your code and hopefully merge to trunk! :)
